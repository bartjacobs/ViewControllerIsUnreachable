#### Author: Bart Jacobs (Cocoacasts)

Storyboards are great for building user interfaces, but it can sometimes be frustrating to debug the cryptic warnings and errors Xcode throws at you. In this episode of **Swift Help**, I show you how to avoid unreachable view controllers when working with storyboards.

I have created a starter project to get us started. You can download the project if you want to follow along with me. The project has two storyboards, **Main.storyboard** and **LaunchScreen.storyboard**. Xcode creates these storyboards for us. We are only interested in **Main.storyboard**.
